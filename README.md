I do not know Rust.

- If you see something that is being done in a suboptimal way at a language-level, I'd love to hear it.
- If you want to argue about how SSR is being handled, you should first know that I don't care. It works. It's still fast.
- If you want to submit a PR and end up with a considerable amount of merge conflicts, please resolve them yourself.
- If you want to submit a PR and end up with a negligible amount of merge conflicts, don't worry I am happy to handle them. It's the least I could do for someone who is bettering the software free of charge.
- If you have an opinion or insight on [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/), I'd love to hear from you on [this](https://github.com/zkxjzmswkwl/Carnival/discussions/54) discussion.
